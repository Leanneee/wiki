# I <3 Bash

Bash is a underappreaciated language. It falls into this same category as
Makefile where developers learn just enough of it to complete their tasks. As
a result most of the bash code out there is written by beginners. Which then
in turn gives a bad reputation to the language.

The number one issue with Bash is variable escaping. If a variable is used in
it's unescaped form and contains one or many whitespace characters in it, it
creates undefined behaviour in the program.
