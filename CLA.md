# On Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This summarises my thoughts on CLA pretty well:

I am not legally binding myself for a free contribution, thank you very much.

* I am giving you my word that I have the right to distribute the change. 
* All my contributions are licensed under the same license as chosen by the
  target project.

That's all. Thanks!

## Acceptable CLA

https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin seems reasonable

https://developercertificate.org/ is good
