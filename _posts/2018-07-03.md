## Markdown links are a bad design decision

Traditionally one would create a reference like `[1]` and put the link below.
Maintaining the mapping is a bit tedious so it's nice to keep links inline
(but introduce a new issue with line wrapping).

It would have been more consistent if links could be inlined
`[https://example.com]` instead to keep the same square brackets notation.

Because of HTML rendering one wants to attach some text to the link. The way
Markdown solves that is by putting the text in square brackets. Eg: `[my
test](https://mylink.com)`. Other notations are possible.

Link quoting variations:

* `[https://mylink.com]`
* `:https://mylink.com`

Text quoting variations
* SingleWord
* "Multiple words"

Now combined:

* `SingleWord:https://mylink.com`
* `"Multiple words":https://mylink.com"`
* `SingleWord[https://mylink.com]`
* `"Multiple words"[https://mylink.com]`

Something like that would have been more natural
