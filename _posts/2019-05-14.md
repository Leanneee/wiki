# Packaging cryptpad
:packaging:
:nix:

## Dependencies

* nodejs 6.x
* bower
* mongodb (runtime?)

## Build system

It looks like they are also targeting arm32 and aarch64

They don't care about packaging. No npm distribution.

The software is designed to run in-source-tree. The configuration file is
designed to be placed in tree.

Bower is deprecated and they know about it https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/295

Somebody already tried to package cryptpad apparently: https://github.com/rvl/bower2nix/issues/10#issuecomment-416269362

The dockerfile is targeting node 6.x which is EOL

## Bower packaging

Too much stuff

add the duplicate bootstrap entry:

```
(fetchbower "bootstrap" "3.1.1" "~3.1.1" "06bhjwa8p7mzbpr3jkgydd804z1nwrkdql66h7jkfml99psv9811")
```

## Scratchpad

could use codimd as an example

depends on bower. https://github.com/rvl/bower2nix

does https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptpad have the pre-generated bower
dependencies?

the NPM version hasn't been updated since 0.1.0

designed to run inside it's own source tree :/
