# Notes on Flakes

look at test/flakes.sh to find out how to use it

It doesn't seem like it's intended to work in a development mode.

Eg:

`nix flake info` doesn't show anything

`nix flake deps` doesn't show anything

```
$ h yarn2nix
$ nix flake init
$ $EDITOR flake.nix

```

## Available commands

```
  add     upsert flake in user flake registry
  clone   clone flake repository
  deps    list informaton about dependencies
  info    list info about a given flake
  init    create a skeleton 'flake.nix' file in the current directory
  list    list available Nix flakes
  pin     pin flake require in user flake registry
  remove  remove flake from user flake registry
  update  update flake lock file
```

## Misc

### Error message

```
$ nix flake 
error: 'nix flake' requires a sub-command.
Try 'nix --help' for more information.
```

It should by `Try 'nix flake --help' for more information.`

### Remote vs local commands

`nix flake init` is local but not the other commands?

### flake init

Should take some more arguments for the name.

Seems to only work in a git repo root.

Avoid the use of `rec`.

Put a disclaimer on top to explain what this file is about.

File the "name" to the repo name by default.

What is the `packages` section, are there others?

### URI notation


```
github:NixOS/nix/flakes
```

It doesn't distinguish between the path and ref. It would make the support for
gitlab difficult since repos can have an arbitrary depth (eg:
gitlab.com/foo/bar/baz can be a repo).

How about using `#` to separate the ref ? This would be the same as
`package.json`.

```
github:NixOS/nix#flakes
```

package.json:
```
"dependencies" : {
  "name1" : "git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish",
}
```

see https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#git-urls-as-dependencies

Another option would be to use a simple k=v format instead of trying to coerce
all the info into a URI-ish.

{ type=github slug=owner/repo ref=branch-name-or-tag-or-rev }

### URI notation v2

The Flake URI notation suffers from similar issues.

```
file://path/to/repo:attrname
```

what if the folder contains a colon?


### Don't like the registry

It adds too much indirection


### Open questions

What is the registry, how can it be used?

How is the lock file generated?



### Flake info

```
$ nix flake info .
error: '.' is not a valid flake reference
$ nix flake info file://$PWD
error: source tree referenced by 'file:///home/zimbatm/go/src/github.com/moretea/yarn2nix?ref=master&rev=3cc020e384ce2a439813adb7a0cc772a034d90bb' does not contain a '/flake.nix' file
$ nix flake info $PWD

How do you access the legacyPkgs ?
```
error: attribute 'legacyPkgs' missing, at /nix/store/4n70gs702qayyadcaqpnfyg1yk1x8fd9-source/flake.nix:9:34
```
