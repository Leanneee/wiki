# Deep dive into Windows Subsystem for Linux 2

https://mybuild.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/77003

It turns out that mapping all the Linux syscalls to the Windows NT kernel is a lot of work. (Did you know that Windows NT used to ship with a [Windows POSIXL Subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_POSIX_subsystem) ? )

WSL2 is running a Linux kernel in a VM instead which fixes all the missing syscalls, makes filesystem much faster.

Only one kernel is running per user, if multiple distros are running they all
run inside of user namespaces inside of the same kernel.

They are able to allocated/deallocate memory dynamically on the host which is pretty neat. The VM memory usage is only what the Linux kernel is using.

They have their own init process, so all distros need to ship service file for their init system.

They use the 9P protocol to mount /mnt/c Meaning that Microsoft has
implemented a Plan 9 technology for the server side. And they have a 9P server
on the linux side as well to mount linux files on Windows.

When executing a .exe from the linux side, they use binfmt to intercept that
call and forward it to the host somehow. All the stdin / stdout / stderr are
forwarded properly.

## Open questions

Which init system is used?

# NLNet project triage

* Lots of mobile apps don't need packaging

## Open questions

* Are projects supposed to ship using OSI-approved licenses?
