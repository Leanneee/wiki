# Exploring how nix-shell works

Goal: find out if nix-shell can be made faster or simpler.

reading [src/nix-build/nix-build.cc](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/f9a2ea44867cd1dbb408bca4df0ced806137b7f7/src/nix-build/nix-build.cc)
it seems like the code is shared between nix-build and nix-shell

## Does setting `NIX_BUILD_SHELL` make `nix-shell` faster?

If `NIX_BUILD_SHELL` is not set, `nix-shell` will evaluate `(import <nixpkgs>
{}).bashInteractive` to find bash so in theroy it should be faster.

This means that it's required to also set the `NIX_PATH` to pin nixpkgs in all
of the cases.

### Test case

```nix
with import <nixpkgs> {};
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    ruby
    bundler
  ];
}
```

Running `time nix-shell --command "echo ok`:

```
time nix-shell --command "echo ok"
bash: /run/user/1000/env-vars: cannot overwrite existing file
ok

real	0m0.850s
user	0m0.624s
sys	0m0.224s
```

after running it 10 times, the lowest value was:

```
real	0m0.777s
user	0m0.563s
sys	0m0.208s

```

now after:
```
$ export NIX_BUILD_SHELL=$(readlink -f "$(which bash)")
```

```
real	0m0.773s
user	0m0.556s
sys	0m0.216s
```

and the lowest value of 10 was:

```
real	0m0.706s
user	0m0.517s
sys	0m0.195s
```

now compare with a naive env:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
in
  pkgs.buildEnv {
    name = "my-env";
    paths = [ pkgs.ruby pkgs.bundler ];
  }
```

```
$ time nix-build env.nix 
/nix/store/98k22wz9rr6vgjynmipwihnk462bgvwq-my-env

real	0m0.316s
user	0m0.254s
sys	0m0.043s
```

### Conclusion

1. `nixpkgs` needs to be pinned using the `NIX_PATH` for completely
   reproducible environments
2. setting NIX_BUILD_SHELL makes nix-shell entry a bit faster but it's not
   substantial.
3. `nix-build` is twice as fast as `nix-shell`
   
## What is the `passAsFile` attribute?

According to the manual, it can be used to serialize large strings to the
store. Then a path is returned as an environment value instead.

## Random tidbits

`shopt -u nullglob` is set in the shell

## Conclusion

Ok I give up for now. Going back to work.






# TODO

generating reference URLs to code is annoying, is there no vim plugin that can
automate that?
