# Software Engineering as a disciplin

A software engineer is a software developer that embraces the task like a
disciplin. And as any disciplin, like martial art, the various aspects get
decomposed and trained inidividually.

As I didn't find much litterature, because I didn't search to be honest, on
the practice. This is my attempt at doing just that. Look at all the things
that I have learned in isolation and try to describe them the best that I can.

# Unstructured thoughts

## Keep a software journal of your activities

This has a lot of benefits:

* context-switching becomes easier.
* the content can easily be extracted into a blog post.
* management relations; it's good to be able to refer back to the work you did
  when asking for a raise or being evaluated.
* reading it later is useful to find meta patters to your work

## If you hit a difficult spot, step away from the computer!

The worse thing you can do is start filling your brain with other stuff like
HackerNews / Twitter.

Use a paper notebook to write things down while away from the computer.

Being bored is the source of all creativity. Go for a walk, do some house
chores that can be done on autopilot like the dishes.

## Use bisect debugging

## Learn things in depth

Don't become a slave of StackOverflow.

There is a loooot to learn though. Pace yourself.

## Write some code every day

Like any skills, it stays shape when trained regularily.

## Read code every day

Learning is also reading what other people are doing. Study the masters.

## Keep the complexity down

## Learn how to communicate

Learning how to describe issues, communicate with management, is an integral
part of the disciplin.

## Health basics

Necessary to keep the brain in shape.

* exercise
* drink water
* always get a good night of sleep
* healthy diet, whatever that is
