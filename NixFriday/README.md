# Nix Friday

When planning for the "[how to read Nix expressions][1]" course for NixCon, I
expected to have a small turnout. Maybe 4-10 people maximum. This was a
second track, not very well advertised. So imagine my surprise when the room
filled up completely!

This made me realize that there is actually a need to teach Nix directly.
Without reading the manual, asking questions on Discourse and all the other
resources available.

So this project is an experiment to see if I can reproduce the NixCon
experience online. That way we don't have to wait another year :)

## Implementation

Since I have never done this before there is probably a lot to learn on my
side as well.

The current idea is to invite 1 student per teaching lesson to get that
interactive classroom feeling. It might work with more but online is a bit
different. There is lag and less clues that make it more likely to step over
each-other. So let's start with one.

The whole course is streamed and bystanders are welcome to comment in the
chat, and we will try to pick those questions up as well. Ideally this would
be the task of the student as I will already be busy thinking and speaking but
we'll see.

## Where
